### 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm an experienced L2/L3 IT Support Engineer working with global e-commerce systems at scale — but beyond incident tickets and monitoring dashboards, I’ve been diving deep into the world of **Java**, **Big Data**, and **AI**.

I love building smart tools, automating workflows, and learning how to make systems more reliable, efficient, and intelligent.

> 🛠️ Working in support means touching many technologies, solving real-world problems fast, and staying constantly up to date.  
> It’s the perfect playground for curious minds — and I’m here for it!
